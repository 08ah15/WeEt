# MyWT
custom modul for webtrees
provides a list of sources in a selected archive missing an attached media object.
This is intended to be used to prepare a visit to the archive and take a look/photo of the source

Background: I have indirect knowledge about birth, marriage or death certificates but have not seen them myself. Side notes or content could point to next items to search for.
