# WeEt
custom modul for webtrees provides a list of sources in a selected archive missing an attached media object.
Here I am focussing on birth, marriage and death certificates of which I have an image attached to the source as media object. This modul is intended to be used to prepare a visit to the archive and take a look/photo of the source mising the media object.
Such list is helpful in case I have indirect knowledge about birth, marriage or death certificates but have not seen the certificates myself. Side notes or content could point to next items to search for.
The modul shall provide the 3 lists, one for each birth, marriage and death certificates containing the certificate titel, year of publication and name(s) of persons concerned (under construction)
